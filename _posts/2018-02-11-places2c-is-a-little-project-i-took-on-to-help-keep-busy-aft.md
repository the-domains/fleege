  Places2C is a little project I took on to help keep busy after a motorcycle
  accident in 2008.  It was a very serious accident and I am very lucky to be
  alive. It is now 10 years after my accident and recovery has been slow.  I
  have finally accepted I can no longer do the things I enjoyed prior to my
  accident with out putting myself and others at risk.

Places2C is a little project I took on to help keep busy after a motorcycle accident in 2008\. It was a very serious accident and I am very lucky to be alive. It is now 10 years after my accident and recovery has been slow. I have finally accepted I can no longer do the things I enjoyed prior to my accident with out putting myself and others at risk.

Just a quick paragraph about myself: I am originally from Ft Dodge, Iowa and I have rode motorcycles and snowmobiles in the 70's, attended college, PROUDLY served in the Air Force, got married to my wife of 35 years and raised two boys in the 80's and most of the 90's but when 2000 came I was back riding motorcycles and ATV's. I was an active member of the American Legion Riders, Patriot Guard and a Board Member of the Iowa Off-Highway Vehicle Association (IOHVA). Another passion I have is learning local history where ever we lived which ties in perfectly with motorcycling and ATVing.

So what does one do when they can no longer participate in what they love? You find other ways to stay active and for me one of those ways is inventory all the historical markers, sites and events I have logged over the years.

Eventually Places2C will be open to all serious motorcycles, ATV and History Buffs. In the mean time if you have some markers please email them in CSV format and I'll add them to the site. I hope you enjoy my attempt to keep busy and learns more about this great country of ours. God Bless.
